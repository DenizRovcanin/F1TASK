My task was to built a SPA (Single Page Application) that will present F1 world champions starting from 2000 up to 2007.Also when a client would select a year of interest,it would open a list of every race during that year and the winners of the same.On the top of the list it shows the world champion for the selected year and his name has been highlighted for every race he had won.I have used resources from Wikipedia as well as the tables, but I have adjusted them according to my needs.
